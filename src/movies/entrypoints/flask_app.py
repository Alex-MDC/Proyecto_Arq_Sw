# clean architecture: coupling is mostly related to the database, which currently is basically a local filem which would be updated with the webscraping
#modules are being created to carry the functionalities of the system to avoid higher coupling. for example preference key generation has its own module
# and also the recommendation creations has a kind of simple factory. the "switch" of the movie recommendation is the rating option as stated in the requirements.
